## What i have learnt By working on this project
1. Got a good understanding on what are css units by my research like `em`, `rem`, `percentages`, `vh` and `vw` etc.

## Honest Time to finish the project

I had took about 20 min to 30 min approximately as it was not that much of a project just took time to adjust `font-size`, `font-color` and `font-weight`
